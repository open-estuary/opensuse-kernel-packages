Subject: [PATCH] nfit: fix region registration vs block-data-window ranges
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.16.3
Git-commit: 8d0d8ed3356aa9ed43b819aaedd39b08ca453007

commit 8d0d8ed3356aa9ed43b819aaedd39b08ca453007 upstream.

Commit 1cf03c00e7c1 "nfit: scrub and register regions in a workqueue"
mistakenly attempts to register a region per BLK aperture. There is
nothing to register for individual apertures as they belong as a set to
a BLK aperture group that are registered with a corresponding
DIMM-control-region. Filter them for registration to prevent some
needless devm_kzalloc() allocations.
