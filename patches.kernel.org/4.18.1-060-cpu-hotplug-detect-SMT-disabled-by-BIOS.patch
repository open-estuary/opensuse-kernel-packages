Subject: [PATCH] cpu/hotplug: detect SMT disabled by BIOS
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.18.1
Git-commit: 1591ccc9fe104401586a93f8d7c6de0e299122f2

If SMT is disabled in BIOS, the CPU code doesn't properly detect it.
The /sys/devices/system/cpu/smt/control file shows 'on', and the 'l1tf'
vulnerabilities file shows SMT as vulnerable.

Fix it by forcing 'cpu_smt_control' to CPU_SMT_NOT_SUPPORTED in such a
case.  Unfortunately the detection can only be done after bringing all
the CPUs online, so we have to overwrite any previous writes to the
variable.
