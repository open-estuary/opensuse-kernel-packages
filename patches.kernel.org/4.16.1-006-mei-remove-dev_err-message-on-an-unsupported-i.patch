Subject: [PATCH] mei: remove dev_err message on an unsupported ioctl
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.16.1
Git-commit: bb0829a741792b56c908d7745bc0b2b540293bcc

commit bb0829a741792b56c908d7745bc0b2b540293bcc upstream.

Currently the driver spams the kernel log on unsupported ioctls which is
unnecessary as the ioctl returns -ENOIOCTLCMD to indicate this anyway.
I suspect this was originally for debugging purposes but it really is not
required so remove it.
