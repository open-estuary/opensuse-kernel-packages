Subject: [PATCH] i2c: core: ACPI: Properly set status byte to 0 for multi-byte
 writes
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.18.5
Git-commit: c463a158cb6c5d9a85b7d894cd4f8116e8bd6be0

commit c463a158cb6c5d9a85b7d894cd4f8116e8bd6be0 upstream.

acpi_gsb_i2c_write_bytes() returns i2c_transfer()'s return value, which
is the number of transfers executed on success, so 1.

The ACPI code expects us to store 0 in gsb->status for success, not 1.

Specifically this breaks the following code in the Thinkpad 8 DSDT:

            ECWR = I2CW = ECWR /* \_SB_.I2C1.BAT0.ECWR */
            If ((ECST == Zero))
            {
                ECRD = I2CR /* \_SB_.I2C1.I2CR */
            }

Before this commit we set ECST to 1, causing the read to never happen
breaking battery monitoring on the Thinkpad 8.

This commit makes acpi_gsb_i2c_write_bytes() return 0 when i2c_transfer()
returns 1, so the single write transfer completed successfully, and
makes it return -EIO on for other (unexpected) return values >= 0.
