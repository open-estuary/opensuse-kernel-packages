Subject: x86/idle: Control Indirect Branch Speculation in idle
Git-repo: git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/djbw/linux.git
Git-commit: ec3bf60dd38f67dace74986b31177892884bb787
Patch-mainline: Queued in subsystem maintainer repository
References: bsc#1068032 CVE-2017-5753

Indirect Branch Speculation (IBS) is controlled per physical core. If one
thread disables it then it's disabled for the core. If a thread enters idle
it makes sense to reenable IBS so the sibling thread can run with full
speculation enabled in user space.

This makes only sense in mwait_idle_with_hints() because mwait_idle() can
serve an interrupt immediately before speculation can be stopped again. SKL
which requires IBRS should use mwait_idle_with_hints() so this is a non
issue and in the worst case a missed optimization.
